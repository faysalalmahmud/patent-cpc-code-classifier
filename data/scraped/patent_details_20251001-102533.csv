US11094040B2,Noise detection method for time-series vegetation index derived from remote sensing images,"A noise detection method for time-series vegetation index (TSVI) derived from remote sensing images. Firstly, unit root test is used to classify observation values of each pixel into a stationary series or a non-stationary series; for the non-stationary, an appropriate mathematical model is used to model discrete TSVI, then differences between actual observation values and prediction values of the model are calculated and recorded as a deviation. As the deviation has removed seasonal components, the non-stationary series is transformed into a stationary series. For a stationary series or deviation data, noise detection is performed based on the assumption that observation values are distributed within a certain range around mean values; then model fitting and noise detection are iteratively carried out with remained observation values—until the iterations reached the maximum number or no noise is detected at one iteration. The time series is then converted back to image space to obtain a noise mask and optimized. The present invention can obtain an accurate noise mask and improve reliability of land surface-related applications.","['G06T5/002', 'G06F18/241', 'H04N1/409', 'G06K9/00657', 'G06K9/40', 'G06T5/004', 'G06T5/008', 'G06T5/70', 'G06T5/75', 'G06T5/94', 'G06V10/30', 'G06V10/764', 'G06V10/84', 'G06V20/188', 'H04N1/4092', 'G06T2207/10036', 'G06T2207/30188']"

US12226234B2,Retrospective retrofitting method to generate a continuous glucose concentration profile by exploiting continuous glucose monitoring sensor data and blood glucose measurements,"Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices provide glucose concentration measurements in the subcutaneous tissue with limited accuracy and precision. Therefore, CGM readings cannot be incorporated in a straightforward manner in outcome metrics of clinical trials e.g. aimed to assess new glycemic-regulation therapies. To define those outcome metrics, frequent Blood Glucose (BG) reference measurements are still needed, with consequent relevant difficulties in outpatient settings. Here we propose a “retrofitting” algorithm that produces a quasi continuous time BG profile by simultaneously exploiting the high accuracy of available BG references (possibly very sparsely collected) and the high temporal resolution of CGM data (usually noisy and affected by significant bias). The inputs of the algorithm are: a CGM time series; some reference BG measurements; a model of blood to interstitial glucose kinetics; and a model of the deterioration in time of sensor accuracy, together with (if available) a priori information (e.g. probabilistic distribution) on the parameters of the model. The algorithm first checks for the presence of possible artifacts or outliers on both CGM datastream and BG references, and then rescales the CGM time series by exploiting a retrospective calibration approach based on a regularized deconvolution method subject to the constraint of returning a profile laying within the confidence interval of the reference BG measurements. As output, the retrofitting algorithm produces an improved “retrofitted” quasi-continuous glucose concentration signal that is better (in terms of both accuracy and precision) than the CGM trace originally measured by the sensor. In clinical trials, the so-obtained retrofitted traces can be used to calculate solid outcome measures, avoiding the need of increasing the data collection burden at the patient level.","['A61B5/7207', 'A61B5/1451', 'A61B5/14532', 'A61B5/1495', 'A61B5/7203', 'A61B5/7264', 'A61B5/7275', 'A61B5/7289', 'G16H10/40', 'G16H50/20', 'G16H50/30']"

US11704409B2,Post-training detection and identification of backdoor-poisoning attacks,"This patent concerns novel technology for detecting backdoors in neural network, particularly deep neural network (DNN) classification or prediction/regression models. The backdoors are planted by suitably poisoning the training dataset, i.e., a data-poisoning attack. Once added to an input sample from a source class of the attack, the backdoor pattern causes the decision of the neural network to change to the attacker's target class in the case of classification, or causes the output of the network to significantly change in the case of prediction or regression. The backdoors under consideration are small in norm so as to be imperceptible to a human or otherwise innocuous/evasive, but this does not limit their location, support or manner of incorporation. There may not be components (edges, nodes) of the DNN which are specifically dedicated to achieving the backdoor function. Moreover, the training dataset used to learn the classifier or predictor/regressor may not be available. In one embodiment of the present invention, which addresses such challenges, if the classifier or predictor/regressor is poisoned then the backdoor pattern is determined through a feasible optimization process, followed by an inference process, so that both the backdoor pattern itself and the associated source class(es) and target class are determined based only on the classifier or predictor/regressor parameters and using a set of clean (unpoisoned) samples, from the different classes (none of which may be training samples).","['G06F21/577', 'G06F21/566', 'G06N20/00', 'G06N3/0464', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N3/09', 'G06N3/094', 'G06N5/045', 'G06F2221/033', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/048']"
