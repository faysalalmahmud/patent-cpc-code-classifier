US20180107940A1,Artificial intelligence method and apparatus,"The invention entails a method of Etiological prioritization based on an original symbolic model of the causative construction of singular logical relations which are built from an initiation of sensed masses in patterns, the naming of sensed patterns into words, the description of the relations of masses using specific English language primitives, the relations between masses and words, and the relations between primitive words. This process is built upon a theory and model of discretized human capabilities and learned experiential meanings. Human capabilities and learned experiential meanings are identified as singular primitives and amount to words identified and matched to singular parts that make up human capabilities and the inventive model of the experiences of the sensing and understanding of the spatiotemporal physical world. Continued etiological development of the inventive model entails new primitive meanings being built via the combination of the inventive model of the primitives of human capabilities with the inventive model of the primitives not representing human capabilities. The method of etiological prioritization is used to create the inventive model of the definitions of many hundreds of English language words and is applied to the explication of specialized domains of knowledge. In accordance with the invention, the method may comprise identifying a plurality of primitive words in a first group, where the primitive words in the first group have a singular meaning. The plurality of primitive words in the first group having a singular meaning are stored at a first set of storage locations in a computing device. A plurality of primitive words in a second group are identified. The plurality of primitive words in the second group have associated meanings which may be defined by the primitive words in the first group and/or other primitive words in the second group. The plurality of primitive words in the second group are stored at a second set of storage locations in a computing device.

US11704409B2,Post-training detection and identification of backdoor-poisoning attacks,"This patent concerns novel technology for detecting backdoors in neural network, particularly deep neural network (DNN) classification or prediction/regression models. The backdoors are planted by suitably poisoning the training dataset, i.e., a data-poisoning attack. Once added to an input sample from a source class of the attack, the backdoor pattern causes the decision of the neural network to change to the attacker's target class in the case of classification, or causes the output of the network to significantly change in the case of prediction or regression. The backdoors under consideration are small in norm so as to be imperceptible to a human or otherwise innocuous/evasive, but this does not limit their location, support or manner of incorporation. There may not be components (edges, nodes) of the DNN which are specifically dedicated to achieving the backdoor function. Moreover, the training dataset used to learn the classifier or predictor/regressor may not be available. In one embodiment of the present invention, which addresses such challenges, if the classifier or predictor/regressor is poisoned then the backdoor pattern is determined through a feasible optimization process, followed by an inference process, so that both the backdoor pattern itself and the associated source class(es) and target class are determined based only on the classifier or predictor/regressor parameters and using a set of clean (unpoisoned) samples, from the different classes (none of which may be training samples).","['G06F21/577', 'G06F21/566', 'G06N20/00', 'G06N3/0464', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N3/09', 'G06N3/094', 'G06N5/045', 'G06F2221/033', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/048']"

US10593182B1,Vehicle operator emotion management system and method,"The method, system, and computer-readable medium facilitates monitoring a vehicle operator during the course of vehicle operation to determine whether the vehicle operator is in an emotionally impaired state (e.g., aggressive or agitated) and presenting appropriate stimuli (e.g., music or sound recordings) to the vehicle operator when impairment is detected. The vehicle operator, the environment surrounding the vehicle, or forces acting on the vehicle may be monitored using a variety of sensors, including optical sensors, accelerometers, or biometric sensors (e.g., skin conductivity, heart rate, or voice modulation). When the vehicle operator is determined to be in an emotionally impaired state, stimuli are selected to improve the emotional state of the vehicle operator. The selection is based on sensor data and data regarding prior responses of the vehicle operator to various stimuli. After selection, the stimuli are presented to the vehicle operator while monitoring continues.","['G08B21/02', 'G06Q30/0283', 'G06Q40/08']"
