US20230210412A1,Retrospective retrofitting method to generate a continuous glucose concentration profile by exploiting continuous glucose monitoring sensor data and blood glucose measurements,"Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices provide glucose concentration measurements in the subcutaneous tissue with limited accuracy and precision. Therefore, CGM readings cannot be incorporated in a straightforward manner in outcome metrics of clinical trials e.g. aimed to assess new glycaemic-regulation therapies. To define those outcome metrics, frequent Blood Glucose (BG) reference measurements are still needed, with consequent relevant difficulties in outpatient settings. Here we propose a “retrofitting” algorithm that produces a quasi continuous time BG profile by simultaneously exploiting the high accuracy of available BG references (possibly very sparsely collected) and the high temporal resolution of CGM data (usually noisy and affected by significant bias). The inputs of the algorithm are: a CGM time series; some reference BG measurements; a model of blood to interstitial glucose kinetics; and a model of the deterioration in time of sensor accuracy, together with (if available) a priori information (e.g. probabilistic distribution) on the parameters of the model. The algorithm first checks for the presence of possible artifacts or outliers on both CGM datastream and BG references, and then rescales the CGM time series by exploiting a retrospective calibration approach based on a regularized deconvolution method subject to the constraint of returning a profile laying within the confidence interval of the reference BG measurements. As output, the retrofitting algorithm produces an improved “retrofitted” quasi-continuous glucose concentration signal that is better (in terms of both accuracy and precision) than the CGM trace originally measured by the sensor. In clinical trials, the so-obtained retrofitted traces can be used to calculate solid outcome measures, avoiding the need of increasing the data collection burden at the patient level.","['A61B5/7207', 'A61B5/14532', 'A61B5/1451', 'A61B5/1495', 'A61B5/7203', 'A61B5/7264', 'A61B5/7275', 'A61B5/7289', 'G16H10/40', 'G16H50/20', 'G16H50/30']"

US12173603B2,Low frequency distributed acoustic sensing hydraulic fracture geometry,"Monitoring and diagnosing completion during hydraulic fracturing operations provides insights into the fracture geometry, inter-well frac hits and connectivity. Conventional monitoring methods (microseismic, borehole gauges, tracers, etc.) can provide a range of information about the stimulated rock volume but may often be limited in detail or clouded by uncertainty. Utilization of DAS as a fracture monitoring tool is growing, however most of the applications have been limited to acoustic frequency bands of the DAS recorded signal. In this paper, we demonstrate some examples of using the low-frequency band of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) signal to constrain hydraulic fracture geometry. DAS data were acquired in both offset horizontal and vertical monitor wells. In horizontal wells, DAS data records formation strain perturbation due to fracture propagation. Events like fracture opening and closing, stress shadow creation and relaxation, ball seat and plug isolation can be clearly identified. In vertical wells, DAS response agrees well with co-located pressure and temperature gauges, and illuminates the vertical extent of hydraulic fractures. DAS data in the low-frequency band is a powerful attribute to monitor small strain and temperature perturbation in or near the monitor wells. With different fibered monitor well design, the far-field fracture length, height, width, and density can be accurately measured using cross-well DAS observations.","['E21B49/00', 'E21B43/26', 'E21B47/113', 'G01V1/42', 'G01V1/208', 'G01V1/226', 'G01V2210/1234', 'G01V2210/1429', 'G01V2210/163', 'G01V2210/646']"

Various approaches address interference from audio overlays added to channels of audio after embedding. One approach applies informed embedding based on phase differences between corresponding components of the channels. A detector extracts the watermark payload effectively from either additive or subtractive combination of the channels because the informed embedding ensures that the watermark survives both types of processing. Other approaches applies different polarity patterns, watermark mappings, or protocol keys to the channels. These techniques enable the watermark to survive ambient mixing, conversion to mono, as well as channel differencing to reduce interference from voice-overs and other audio overlays.","['G10L19/018', 'G10L19/02', 'G10L19/06', 'G10L21/013', 'G10L21/04', 'G10L21/043', 'G10L25/90']"

Error calculations are performed in the sensor reference frame rather than in the Earth reference frame.

The set of time-based measurements identified for each vehicle are combined to obtain a combined set of time-based observations for the measurement type across the population of vehicles or a sub-set of the population defined by vehicle make, model, and/or year of production. An outlier observation is identified from among the combined set of time-based observations. A determination is made whether the outlier observation is part of a temporary deviation or a persistent deviation. For a temporary deviation, an impact of the outlier observation on the set of time-based measurements is reduced. For a persistent deviation, the outlier observation is programmatically characterized.","['G07C5/008', 'G07C5/002', 'G07C5/0825', 'G07C5/085', 'G06Q10/20', 'G07C5/0808']"

The illustrated methods and systems create one or more mathematically-derived biopotential signals (e.g., virtual biopotential signals) from data of the individually measured biopotential signals through mathematical operations (i.e., by numerical fractional derivative calculations on the signals in the frequency domain) that are used in conjunction with the measured biopotential signals to generate a multi-dimensional phase-space representation of the body (e.g., the heart). By mathematically modulating (e.g., by expanding or contracting) portions of a given biopotential signal in the frequency domain, numerical-based operations impart emphasis or de-emphasis on certain measured frequencies of the biopotential signal, which when combined with machine learning, help improve the diagnosis of certain conditions.","['G16H50/20', 'A61B5/02', 'A61B5/24', 'A61B5/283', 'A61B5/316', 'A61B5/4848', 'A61B5/725', 'A61B5/7257', 'A61B5/726', 'A61B5/7264', 'A61B5/7275', 'A61B5/7278', 'A61B5/341', 'A61B5/6801', 'A61B5/681', 'A61B5/6823', 'A61B5/6824', 'A61B5/7203', 'A61B5/7267']"

US11538565B1,Decision support tool for managing autoimmune inflammatory disease,"Decision support technology is provided for use with patients who may experience respiratory deterioration. A mechanism is provided to determine whether a patient is experiencing (or is likely to experience at a future time) an autoimmune inflammatory event, which may include performing a spectral analysis on a time series of nocturnal or axillary temperatures for the patient to determine a spectrum slope or intercept. The time series may be demeaned, detrended, and apodized before performing the spectral analysis. A comparison of the slope or intercept with a baseline value is used to determine an indication of the patient's likely condition or future condition regarding the autoimmune inflammatory event. Based on the comparison, an intervening action may be invoked, such as alerting a caregiver, providing a recommendation or modified treatment, or determining and recommending a tailored prescription of medicine for the patient.","['G16H10/65', 'G06F16/90', 'G06F16/955', 'G06Q50/22', 'G16H10/60', 'G16H40/63', 'G16H50/30', 'G16Z99/00', 'G06F21/6245']"
