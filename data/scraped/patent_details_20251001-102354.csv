US11475130B2,Detection of test-time evasion attacks,"Embodiments of the present invention concern detecting Test-Time Evasion (TTE) attacks on neural network, particularly deep neural network (DNN), classifiers. The manner of detection is similar to that used to detect backdoors of a classifier whose training dataset was poisoned. Given knowledge of the classifier itself, the adversary subtly (even imperceptibly) perturbs their input to the classifier at test time in order to cause the class decision to change from a source class to a target class. For example, an image of a person who is unauthorized to access a resource can be modified slightly so that the classifier decides the image is that of an authorized person. The detector is based on employing a method (similar to that used to detect backdoors in DNNs) to discover different such minimal perturbations for each in a set of clean (correctly classified) samples, to change the sample's ground-truth (source) class to every other (target) class. For each (source, target) class pair, null distributions of the sizes of these perturbations are modeled. A test sample is similarly minimally perturbed by the detector from its decided-upon (target) class to every other (potential source) class. The p-values according to the corresponding null distributions of these test-sample perturbations are assessed using the corresponding nulls to decide whether the test sample is a TTE attack.","['G06F21/554', 'G06F17/18', 'G06F18/2155', 'G06K9/6259', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N5/003', 'G06N5/01', 'G06V10/764', 'G06V10/774', 'G06V10/7753', 'G06V10/7788', 'G06V10/82', 'G06V20/95', 'G06V40/172', 'G06F2221/033']"

The system manages digital identities, which are digital objects that contain attributes used for the identification of persons and other entities in an IT system and for making identity claims. The identity objects are encoded and cryptographically encapsulated. Identity management protocols include the creation of identities, the validation of their binding to real-world entities, and their secure and reliable storage, protection, distribution, verification, updates, and use. The identities are included in a specially constructed global, distributed, append-only public identities ledger. They are forward- and backward-linked using the mechanism of digital signatures. The linking of objects and their chaining in the ledger is based on and reflect their mutual validation relationships. The identities of individual members are organized in the form of linked structures called the personal identities chains. Identities of groups of users that validated identities of other users in a group are organized in community identities chains. The ledger and its chains support accurate and reliable validation of identities by other members of the system and by application services providers without the assistance of third parties. The ledger designed in this invention may be either permissioned or unpermissioned. Permissioned ledgers have special entities, called BIX Security Policy Providers, which validate the binding of digital identities to real-world entities based on the rules of a given security policy. In unpermissioned ledgers, community members mutually validate their identities. The identity management system provides security, privacy, and anonymity for digital identities and satisfies the requirements for decentralized, anonymous identities management systems.","['H04L9/50', 'H04L63/0435', 'H04L63/0428', 'H04L63/06', 'H04L63/20', 'H04L67/104', 'H04L9/14', 'H04L9/30', 'H04L9/3239', 'H04L9/3247', 'H04L9/3263', 'H04L9/3297']"
