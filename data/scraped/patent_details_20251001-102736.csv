The improved method utilizes a capsule network with dynamic routing. Capsule networks allow for the preservation of information about the input by replacing max-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for the reconstruction of an input image from output capsule vectors. The present invention expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object segmentation and medical image-based cancer diagnosis for the first time in the literature; extends the idea of convolutional capsules with locally-connected routing and propose the concept of deconvolutional capsules; extends the masked reconstruction to reconstruct the positive input class; and proposes a capsule-based pooling operation for diagnosis. The convolutional-deconvolutional capsule network shows strong results for the tasks of object segmentation and classification with substantial decrease in parameter space.","['G06T7/11', 'G06N20/10', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/0455', 'G06N3/0464', 'G06N3/0495', 'G06N3/084', 'G06N3/09', 'G06T7/0012', 'G06T2207/10081', 'G06T2207/20081', 'G06T2207/20084', 'G06T2207/30064']"

According to the prediction method, foreign exchange time series data is analyzed and predicted on the basis of a deep learning algorithm C-LSTM, which combines a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory network, and a short-term prediction method for a foreign exchange time series is proposed. Three kinds of main factors affecting the prediction precision are systematically studied. The optimal input feature, network structure and training method are selected. As for the problem of big data noise, a feature optimization algorithm is constructed on the basis of PCA to perform dimension reduction and denoising on input features, and Dropout and L2 regularization methods are then used to avoid the problem of over-fitting, thereby further improving the prediction precision of the prediction method. At the same time, in order to meet the requirement of a foreign exchange market for high time effectiveness, a parallel optimization algorithm is constructed on the basis of high-performance GPU computing technology, thereby increasing the training speed of a network model and improving the availability of the prediction method in actual application scenarios.","['G06Q10/04', 'G06F18/2135', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/084', 'G06Q10/0639', 'G06Q40/04']"

For several classes of common model functions, it can be proved that the resulting matrix has a low rank or approximately low rank, allowing a matrix estimation technique, for example singular value thresholding, to be efficiently applied. Applying such a technique produces a mean matrix that estimates latent values, of the physical process at times or intervals corresponding to measurements, with less error than previously known methods. These latent values have been denoised (if noisy) and imputed (if missing). Linear regression of the estimated latent values permits forecasting with an error that decreases as more measurements are made.","['G06F17/16', 'G06F17/18', 'G06N7/01', 'G01D1/02', 'G01D1/14', 'G05B2219/37524', 'G06N20/00']"

US20240273737A1,System and method for transforming video data into directional object count,"The present invention is a computer-implemented system and method for transforming video data into directional object counts. The method of transforming video data is uniquely efficient in that it uses only a single column or row of pixels in a video camera to define the background from a moving object, count the number of objects and determine their direction. By taking an image of a single column or row every frame and concatenating them together, the result is an image of the object that has passed, referred to herein as a sweep image. In order to determine the direction, two different methods can be used. Method one involves constructing another image using the same method. The two images are then compared, and the direction is determined by the location of the object in the second image compared to the location of the object in the first image. Due to this recording method, elongation or compression of the objects can occur because of acceleration or deceleration of the objects and can be uniquely utilized to determine the speed or movement path of the objects. The second method of determining direction involves comparing the object in the image to an established marker. The transformations can also be used to produce labeled data for training machine learning models; bounding-boxes provided in sweep image can be transformed to bound boxes in video, and boxes in video can be transformed into boxes in the sweep image.","['G06T7/254', 'G06N20/00', 'G06T5/50', 'G06T7/215', 'G06V20/52', 'G06T2207/20081', 'G06T2207/30236', 'G06T2207/30242']"

For example, the scene graph can be modeling semantic and/or spatial relationships between objects in the image. This approach exploits an underlying structure and interaction among objects in the image with respect to various questions, thus providing strong insight into the image as well as its graphical structure. The question answering task is modelled as a path-finding problem on scene graphs. The underlying idea can be summarized with the phrase: Learn to walk to the correct answer. In particular, techniques from visual question answering and statistical relational learning are combined advantageously. The extracted path provides an inherent transparency mechanism. The gap between symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning methods is bridged by combining explicit reasoning over symbolic entities with the flexibility of methods that fall under the representation learning paradigm. In other words, a novel approach that combines statistical relational learning with visual question answering is provided.

US12190448B2,3D surface structure estimation using neural networks for autonomous systems and applications,"In various examples, to support training a deep neural network (DNN) to predict a dense representation of a 3D surface structure of interest, a training dataset is generated using a simulated environment. For example, a simulation may be run to simulate a virtual world or environment, render frames of virtual sensor data (e.g., images), and generate corresponding depth maps and segmentation masks (identifying a component of the simulated environment such as a road). To generate input training data, 3D structure estimation may be performed on a rendered frame to generate a representation of a 3D surface structure of the road. To generate corresponding ground truth training data, a corresponding depth map and segmentation mask may be used to generate a dense representation of the 3D surface structure.","['G06T17/20', 'B60W30/143', 'B60W40/06', 'B60W50/06', 'B60W60/0015', 'G06F18/214', 'G06F18/24', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N3/084', 'G06T17/00', 'G06T7/11', 'G06T7/40', 'G06V10/454', 'G06V10/774', 'G06V10/82', 'G06V20/56', 'B60W2420/403', 'B60W2420/408', 'G06T2200/08', 'G06T2207/20081', 'G06T2207/20084', 'G06V10/803']"
