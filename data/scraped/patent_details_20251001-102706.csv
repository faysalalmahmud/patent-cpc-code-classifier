The result is that, once optimised, the ANNs can process any file, parsed with those properties, to identify other files sharing common traits reflective of emotional perception, thereby rendering a more liable and true-to-life result of similarity/dissimilarity. This contrasts with simply training a neural network to consider extractable measurable properties that, in isolation, do not provide a reliable contextual relationship into the real-world.","['G06F16/55', 'G06F16/65', 'G06F16/9024', 'G06F18/21', 'G06F18/22', 'G06F40/30', 'G06K9/6215', 'G06K9/6217', 'G06N3/04', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N3/084', 'G06V10/454', 'G06V10/82', 'G10H1/0008', 'G10L15/30', 'G10L25/51', 'G06N3/044', 'G06N3/048', 'G06N3/105', 'G10H2210/041', 'G10H2210/066', 'G10H2210/076', 'G10H2210/081', 'G10H2240/141', 'G10H2250/311', 'G10L25/30', 'G10L25/66']"

Practical applications of video recognition require a label scheme that is appealing to the end-user (i.e. obtained from social curation) and a training dataset that can be updated in real-time to be able to recognize new actions, scenes and people. To create this dataset that evolves in real-time and uses labels that are relevant to the users, a weakly-supervised deep learning approach is utilized combining both a machine-learning pre-processing stage together with a set of keywords obtained from the internet. The resulting tags combined with videos and summaries of videos are used with deep learning to train a neural network in an unsupervised manner that allows the tagging system to go from an image to a set of tags for the image and then to the visual representation of a tag.","['G06F16/783', 'G06F16/71', 'G06F16/00', 'G06F16/73', 'G06F16/75', 'G06F16/7867', 'G06F40/30', 'G06K9/00751', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/0454', 'G06N3/0464', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N3/084', 'G06N3/088', 'G06N3/0895', 'G06N3/092', 'G06N5/022', 'G06V20/47', 'G11B27/34']"
