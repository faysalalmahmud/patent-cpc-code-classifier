Training or tuning a generative AI model typically requires manual review of outputs from the model based on the queries provided to the model to reduce hallucinations generated by the generative AI model. Once the model is in use, though, hallucinations still occur. Use of a confidence (whose generation is described herein) to train or tune the generative AI model and/or manage operation of the model reduces hallucinations, and thus improves performance, of the generative AI model. 29 20 24 20 38 46 06 J un 2 02 4 2 3 1 2 7 5 8 A U A B S T R A C T S y s t e m s a n d m e t h o d s a r e d i s c l o s e d f o r m a n a g i n g a g e n e r a t i v e a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e 2 0 2 4 2 0 3 8 4 6 0 6 J u n 2 0 2 4 ( A I ) m o d e l .
