However, biological signals hidden in portrait videos which are neither spatially nor temporally preserved in fake content, can be used as implicit descriptors of authenticity. 99.39% accuracy in pairwise separation is achieved. A generalized classifier for fake content is formulated by analyzing signal transformations and corresponding feature sets. Signal maps are generated, and a CNN employed to improve the classifier for detecting synthetic content. Evaluation on several datasets produced superior detection rates against baselines, independent of the source generator, or properties of available fake content. Experiments and evaluations include signals from various facial regions, under image distortions, with varying segment durations, from different generators, against unseen datasets, and under several dimensionality reduction techniques.","['G06N3/08', 'G06F18/2411', 'G06F18/2415', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/047', 'G06N3/048', 'G06V10/764', 'G06V10/82', 'G06V20/41', 'G06V20/46', 'G06V40/161', 'G06V40/169', 'G06V40/40', 'G06V40/45', 'G06N20/10', 'G06V40/15']"

The iADC's linearity is improved by utilizing a thermometer current mode signal conditioning method, SCM. Successive applications of the SCM effectuates a segmented current reference network to function like a thermometer network, which operates based on the function of summation. Having a TiADC with a thermometer reference network, where current segments are summed or accumulated incrementally, would inherently reduce the impact of statistical distribution of component's random mismatch on the iADC's non-linearity. Accordingly, linearity of TiADC can be improved by the square root of the sum of the square of mismatch errors of the number of segmented current references in the thermometer network. (2) speed is improved by operating the TiADC in current mode, which is inherently faster. (3) voltage swings in current mode are small, which enables he iADC to operate at lower power supply voltages. (4) The TiADC can operate in subthreshold and at very low currents, which lower powers consumption. (5) the TiADC is asynchronous. Being clock free, TiADC has lower dynamic power consumption with reduces digital system noise. (6) the signal conditioning method or SCM utilized in TiADC provides concurrent functions of analog differencing and digital comparison. This trait enhances the dynamic response of iADC, wherein the digital output throughput accuracy degrades gradually and not abruptly as a function of increasing frequency of iADC's input signal.

AU2024200810B2,Training tree-based machine-learning modeling algorithms for predicting outputs and generating explanatory data,"#$%^&*AU2024200810B220250814.pdf##### Abstract Certain aspects involve training tree-based machine-learning models for computing predicted responses and generating explanatory data for the models. For example, independent variables having relationships with a response variable are identified. Each independent variable corresponds to an action or observation for an entity. The response variable has outcome values associated with the entity. Splitting rules are used to generate the tree-based model, which includes decision trees for determining relationships between independent variables and a predicted response associated with the response variable. The tree-based model is iteratively adjusted to enforce monotonicity with respect to representative response values of the terminal nodes. For instance, one or more decision trees are adjusted such that one or more representative response values are modified and a monotonic relationship exists between each independent variable and the response variable. The adjusted model is used to output explanatory data indicating relationships between independent variable changes and response variable changes.

During off-line training databases of medical conditions and associated diagnostic factors, tests and treatments are used to create models used for later natural language processing of input electronic text. Diagnostic factors are ranked according to the probability that they indicate conditions and are stored in a matrix. Treatments corresponding to conditions are also stored in a matrix. During real-time operation electronic text is received from patient history of an EHR system, from a transcribed conversation between a physician and a patient, or from input that the physician makes in the EHR system or in an overlaid diagnostic user interface. The electronic text is processed by an NLP pipeline that derives clinical diagnostic factors and test results for the patient. The factors and test results are matched against the matrix of factors to produce a list of likely conditions, along with an ordered list of factors and tests that are either unknown or not yet performed for that patient.","['G16H50/20', 'G16H20/00', 'G10L15/22', 'G10L15/26', 'G10L25/66', 'G16H10/40', 'G16H10/60', 'G16H40/20', 'G16H50/70', 'G16H70/20', 'G06F40/295', 'G06F40/30', 'Y02A90/10']"

Based on a pre-inserted key, the accompanying music is re-ordered from an original track and selected automatically - optionally in real-time - to accompany detected or identified changing physical events, such as a heart-rate sensed and reported during a cardio-workout session.

Embodiments described herein provide efficient solutions for these problems by leveraging tools from compressive sensing and deep learning. Consequently, an LIS architecture based on sparse channel sensors is provided where all LIS elements are passive reconfigurable elements except for a few elements that are active (e.g., connected to baseband). Two solutions are developed that design LIS reflection matrices with negligible training overhead. First, compressive sensing tools are leveraged to construct channels at all the LIS elements from the channels seen only at the active elements. These full channels can then be used to design the LIS reflection matrices with no training overhead. Second, a deep learning-based solution is deployed where the LIS learns how to optimally interact with the incident signal given the channels at the active elements, which represent the current state of the environment and transmitter/receiver locations.","['H01Q15/148', 'H04B7/04013']"

Plants in an indoor farm are continuously monitored and the light energy intensity and spectral output are automatically adjusted to optimal levels at optimal times to create better crops. The methods and systems are self-regulating in that light controls the plant's growth, and the plant's growth in-turn controls the spectral output and intensity of the light.","['G06N3/08', 'G06N3/0418', 'G06N3/045', 'G06T7/0002', 'G06T7/0004', 'G06V10/82', 'G06V20/10', 'G06V20/188', 'G06N20/10', 'G06N20/20', 'G06N5/01', 'G06T2207/10024', 'G06T2207/10048', 'G06T2207/30128', 'G06T2207/30188', 'G06V10/454', 'G06V20/194']"

This invention enables (1) the placement of sensors in optimal positions for the viewership data measurement and (2) the estimation of the site-wide viewership of the target display by performing the viewership extrapolation based on the sampled viewership data. The viewership extrapolation problem is formulated in a way that the time-varying crowd dynamics around the target display is an important decisive factor as well as the sampled viewership data at a given time in yielding the estimated site-wide viewership. To solve this problem, the system elements that affect the viewership—site, display, crowd, and audience—and their relationships are first identified in terms of the visibility, the viewership relevancy, and the crowd occupancy. The optimal positions of the sensors are determined to cover the maximum area of the viewership with high probabilities. The viewership extrapolation function is then modeled and learned from the sampled viewership data, the site-wide viewership data, and the crowd dynamics measurements while removing the noise in the sampled viewership data using the viewership relevancy of the measurements to the target display.","['H04N21/44218', 'G06V20/53', 'H04N21/4223', 'H04H60/33']"
