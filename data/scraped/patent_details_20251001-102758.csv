US11010258B2,Generating backup copies through interoperability between components of a data storage management system and appliances for data storage and deduplication,"Illustrative storage manager and media agent are enhanced to interoperate with deduplication appliances. Advantages are realized when making secondary and tertiary copies and also when restoring from a deduplication appliance. Tiered indexing minimizes how much data is retained and stored at media agents. Tiered indexing enables media agents to efficiently extract needed information from deduplication appliances to make tertiary copies and to restore backed up copies. Interoperability techniques include media agents generating separate data streams to the deduplication appliance. Each data stream carries a different kind of data, e.g., payload data, metadata content, or high-level index information. On initial backup, the media agent instructs the deduplication appliance to deduplicate the payload data stream but not the other data streams, thus intelligently applying resources to data most likely to benefit from deduplication. For tertiary copies (copies of pre-existing copies at the deduplication appliance), the media agent avoids handling payload data altogether.","['G06F11/1453', 'G06F11/1458', 'G06F16/174', 'G06F2201/84']"

The remote client remains a full-fledged client in its home system, the remote storage management system.","['H04L63/0823', 'G06F11/14', 'G06F11/1402', 'G06F11/1451', 'G06F11/1464', 'G06F11/2094', 'G06F11/3034', 'G06F11/3433', 'G06F3/0604', 'G06F3/0619', 'G06F3/0622', 'G06F3/0637', 'G06F3/0647', 'G06F3/0649', 'G06F3/065', 'G06F3/0659', 'G06F3/067', 'H04L63/102', 'H04L67/1095', 'H04L69/40', 'G06F21/6218', 'H04L67/01', 'H04L67/42']"

In one example, a recording device with one or more cameras and one or more inertial measurement units captures images and motion data along a real path through a physical environment. A SLAM application uses the captured data to calculate the trajectory of the recording device. A polynomial interpolation module uses Chebyshev polynomials to generate a continuous time trajectory (CTT) function. The method includes identifying a virtual environment and assembling a simulated sensor configuration, such as a VR headset. Using the CTT function, the method includes generating a ground truth output dataset that represents the simulated sensor configuration in motion along a virtual path through the virtual environment. The virtual path is closely correlated with the motion along the real path as captured by the recording device. Accordingly, the output dataset produces a realistic and life-like VR experience. In addition, the methods described can be used to generate multiple output datasets, at various sample rates, which are useful for training the machine-learning algorithms which are part of many VR systems.","['G06T15/20', 'G06T19/003', 'G06T7/20', 'G06T7/50', 'G06T7/70', 'G06T2207/20081', 'G06T2207/20084', 'G06T2207/30241', 'G06T2207/30244', 'G06T2210/41']"

Once a file is written to a directory or folder on a specially designated network share, such as one that is configured for “infinite backup,” an intermediary pre-backup copy of the file is created in an expandable cache in the file server that hosts the network share. On write operations, cache storage space can be dynamically expanded or freed up by pruning previously backed up data. This advantageously creates flexible storage caches in the file server for each network share, each cache managed independently of other like caches for other network shares on the same file server. On read operations, intermediary file storage in the expandable cache gives client computing devices speedy access to data targeted for backup, which is generally quicker than restoring files from backed up secondary copies.","['G06F16/1748', 'G06F9/45558', 'G06F11/1466', 'G06F11/1469', 'G06F16/172', 'G06F16/1844', 'G06F3/0608', 'G06F3/0643', 'G06F3/0652', 'G06F3/067', 'G06F11/1076', 'G06F11/1446', 'G06F11/1448', 'G06F11/2089', 'G06F2009/45579', 'G06F2211/1009']"
