A vehicle, such as an autonomous vehicle, can be controlled to traverse an environment based on the predicted locations.","['B60W30/0956', 'B60W30/09', 'B60W30/18154', 'B60W50/0097', 'G06K9/00348', 'G06K9/00805', 'G06N20/00', 'G06N3/044', 'G06N3/0442', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/0464', 'G06N3/084', 'G06N3/09', 'G06N5/046', 'G06V10/764', 'G06V10/82', 'G06V20/56', 'G06V20/58', 'G06V40/25', 'B60W2554/4029', 'B60W2554/4042', 'B60W2554/801', 'B60W2554/802']"

In at least one embodiment, a score-based generative model can use a stochastic differential equation with critically-damped Langevin diffusion to learn to synthesize content. During a forward diffusion process, noise can be introduced into a set of auxiliary (e.g., “velocity”) values for an input image to learn a score function. This score function can be used with the stochastic differential equation during a reverse diffusion denoising process to remove noise from the image to generate a reconstructed version of the input image. A score matching objective for the critically-damped Langevin diffusion process can require only the conditional distribution learned from the velocity data. A stochastic differential equation-based integrator can then allow for efficient sampling from these critically-damped Langevin diffusion-based models.","['G06T5/70', 'G06N3/045', 'G06N3/0454', 'G06N3/047', 'G06N3/0472', 'G06N3/0475', 'G06N3/09', 'G06N3/096', 'G06T5/60', 'G06T7/277', 'G06V10/772', 'G06V10/82', 'G06T2207/20081', 'G06T2207/20084', 'G06V10/774']"

The passwords may be easy for a human to remember—and yet have an extremely high number of permutations (e.g., in some cases, greater than 1030 permutations, or greater than 10261 permutations, or greater than 106264 permutations). This combination of a password being easy for a human to remember—yet having a large number of permutations—offers many practical benefits. Among other things, the huge number of permutations makes the password extremely resistant to guessing attacks. In addition, in some cases, the passwords that are created with the shapes are highly resistant to attacks by keystroke logging, mouse logging, touch-gesture logging, screen logging, shoulder surfing, phishing, and social engineering. Alternatively, the shapes may be used to encode other information, such as information that uniquely identifies a product or a machine part.","['G06F21/36', 'G06F21/46', 'G06T17/20', 'G06T19/20', 'G06T2219/2004', 'H04L63/083']"

In a parking scenario, switching control laws are used to drive the vehicle to a target line, and a forward path segment and a reverse path segment defined. The two path segments are connected along the target line to define a path for entering or exiting the parking space. Objects in a driving environment may be avoided by identifying an obstacle corner, defining an avoidance circle (62), (185) around the obstacle corner, and determining a path that allows the vehicle to avoid penetrating the avoidance circle. A line-of-sight guidance method may be used to follow the path by defining target points on the path at a lookout distance l, and steering the vehicle using the target points.","['B62D15/0285', 'G05D1/021', 'G05D1/69', 'G05D2201/02']"

This system can ascertain the CAN signals' boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (binary-to-integer encoding) from raw CAN data. This allows conversion of CAN data to time series. Interpreting the translated CAN data's physical meaning and finding a linear mapping to standard units (e.g., knowing the signal is speed and scaling values to represent units of miles per hour) can be achieved for many signals by leveraging diagnostic standards to obtain real-time measurements of in-vehicle systems. The system can be integrated into lightweight hardware enabling an OBD-II plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding or run on standard computers.

The video frames viewed in the HMD are a result of interactive play performed for viewing on the HMD. The second screen is configured to present an undistorted view of the interactive play on the HMD. In one example, the method and system enable additional content to be presented on the second screen (e.g., second screen content, such as social interaction play with others, other non-game content, player-player communications, etc.).","['G06F3/1454', 'A63F13/213', 'A63F13/26', 'A63F13/27', 'A63F13/53', 'A63F13/54', 'A63F13/86', 'G02B27/0093', 'G02B27/01', 'G02B27/017', 'G02B30/34', 'G06F3/002', 'G06F3/011', 'G06F3/012', 'G06T1/20', 'G06T19/006', 'G06T19/20', 'A63F2300/538', 'G06T2210/22', 'G06T2219/024', 'G06T2219/2016']"
US12141535B2,Techniques for maintaining rhetorical flow,"Disclosed systems, devices, and methods improve dialogue management through the use of dialogue discourse trees (DDTs). To determine whether a candidate response (CR) is appropriate in the dialogue, the CR can be added to other utterances that have been previously provided in a dialogue between two parties and a dialogue discourse tree (DDT) can be generated from the result. The DDT includes nodes corresponding to elementary discourse units (EDUs) representing text fragments of the utterances and the CR. The DDT may include nodes that indicate rhetorical relationships between EDUs. In some embodiments, the DDT comprises a node representing at least one dialogue-specific rhetorical relationship between two utterances. The DDT for the CR can be provided to a machine-learning model that has been trained to identify whether the rhetorical flow is maintained between the utterances of the DDT. If so, the CR can be provided in response to the request.","['G06F16/322', 'G06F16/3329', 'G06F18/22', 'G06F40/211', 'G06F40/35', 'G06F40/44', 'G06F40/51', 'G06F40/55', 'G06N20/10', 'G06N3/08', 'G06N3/09', 'G06N5/01', 'G06N20/00']"
