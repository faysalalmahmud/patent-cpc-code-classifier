US20200265070A1,Social network driven indexing system for instantly clustering people with concurrent focus on same topic into on topic chat rooms and/or for generating on-topic search results tailored to user preferences regarding topic,A machine-implemented social networking system builds up and repeatedly refreshes a hierarchy tree containing topic nodes. New nodes are added as new topics emerge in online public forums. Each topic node can link to an on-topic real time chat room whose occupants are currently discussing the topic of the node. A chat room can be pointed to by more than one node if the room is discussing multiple topics. Rooms can migrate from node to node as room topic dynamically changes. A system user who explicitly or inferentially wishes to be invited into a chat room which is on-topic with what the user is currently focused upon can do so by use of a node-seeking automated process. The process operates in the background and seeks out nodes of the hierarchy tree that currently have topics appearing to be the same as or similar to what topics the user appears to have in mind. Content browsing experience of the user is enhanced by addition of an invitations displaying subsystem that automatically invites him or her to co-compatible chat rooms currently discussing the topic(s) the user appears to have in mind. One of the many topics that a user may inferentially have in mind is that of being at a given location as reported by the user's GPS and wondering what best to do at that location and time.,"['G06F16/285', 'G06Q10/10', 'G06Q30/02']"

The fault-tolerant scheme allows routers to switch among several different fault-tolerant operations. Each operation mode has different trade-offs among fault-tolerant capability, retransmission traffic, latency, and energy efficiency.

The example control policy uses example machine learning algorithm called reinforcement learning (RL). The example RL-based controller independently observes a set of NoC system parameters at runtime, and over time they evolve optimal per-router control policies. By automatically and optimally switching among the four fault-tolerant modes, the trained control policy results in minimizing system level network latency and maximizing energy efficiency while detecting and correcting errors.","['G06F13/4027', 'H03M13/09', 'H03M13/2906', 'H03M13/6306', 'H04L1/0044', 'H04L1/0053', 'H04L1/0057', 'H04L1/1896', 'H04L45/08', 'H04L47/125', 'H04L49/15', 'H04L49/557', 'H04L49/90', 'Y02D10/00']"
