The first system processes images to decode digital watermark payload data found on certain of the items (e.g., plastic containers). This payload data is used to look up corresponding attribute metadata for the items in a database, such as the type of plastic in each item, and whether the item was used as a food container or not. The second analysis system can be a spectroscopy system that determines the type of plastic in each item by its absorption characteristics. When the two systems conflict in identifying the plastic type, a sorting logic processor applies a rule set to arbitrate the conflict and determine which plastic type is most likely. The item is then sorted into one of several different bins depending on a combination of the final plastic identification, and whether the item was used as a food container or not. A variety of other features and arrangements are also detailed.","['G06V30/224', 'B07C5/3416', 'B07C5/3422', 'B29B17/02', 'B65G47/493', 'G05B13/027', 'G06F18/21', 'G06F18/24', 'G06F18/256', 'G06T1/0014', 'G06T1/0021', 'G06T7/0004', 'G06T7/90', 'G06V10/454', 'G06V10/811', 'G06V10/82', 'H04N23/56', 'H04N23/73', 'H04N7/18', 'B07C2501/0054', 'B29B17/0412', 'B29B2017/0203', 'B29B2017/0279', 'B29B2017/0282', 'G06T2207/10024', 'G06T2207/10048', 'G06T2207/20084', 'G06T2207/30108', 'G06V10/58', 'G06V2201/06']"

C-scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations, and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes.

Bayesian networks are a compact representation for probabilistic models and inference. They have been used successfully for many applications involving classification. The tree-based classifiers, on the other hand, have proven their ability to perform well in real world data under uncertainty. For classification purposes, the inference algorithms to compute the exact posterior probability of a target node, given observed evidence in a Bayesian network, are usually computationally intensive or impossible in a mixed model. In those cases, either the approximate results are computed using stochastic simulation methods or the model is approximated using discretization or Gaussian mixture before applying an exact inference algorithm. For a tree-based classifier, however, once the tree is constructed, the classification process is trivial. The hybrid approach synergistically combines the strengths of the two techniques.

US20110202322A1,Computer Implemented Method for Discovery of Markov Boundaries from Datasets with Hidden Variables,"Methods for Markov boundary discovery are important recent developments in pattern recognition and applied statistics, primarily because they offer a principled solution to the variable/feature selection problem and give insight about local causal structure. Currently there exist two major local method families for identification of Markov boundaries from data: methods that directly implement the definition of the Markov boundary and newer compositional Markov boundary methods that are more sample efficient and thus often more accurate in practical applications. However, in the datasets with hidden (i.e., unmeasured or unobserved) variables compositional Markov boundary methods may miss some Markov boundary members. The present invention circumvents this limitation of the compositional Markov boundary methods and proposes a new method that can discover Markov boundaries from the datasets with hidden variables and do so in a much more sample efficient manner than methods that directly implement the definition of the Markov boundary. In general, the inventive method transforms a dataset with many variables into a minimal reduced dataset where all variables are needed for optimal prediction of some response variable. The power of the invention was empirically demonstrated with data generated by Bayesian networks and with 13 real datasets from a diversity of application domains.","['G06N20/00', 'G06F18/295', 'G06N5/02']"
