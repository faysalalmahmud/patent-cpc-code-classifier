US8015127B2,"System, method, and computer-accessible medium for providing a multi-objective evolutionary optimization of agent-based models","Agent-based models (ABMs)/multi-agent systems (MASs) are one of the most widely used modeling-simulation-analysis approaches for understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems. These models can be often characterized by several parameters with nonlinear interactions which together determine the global system dynamics, usually measured by different conflicting criteria. One problem that can emerge is that of tuning the controllable system parameters at the local level, in order to reach some desirable global behavior. According to one exemplary embodiment t of the present invention, the tuning of an ABM for emergency response planning can be cast as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). Further, the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and procedures for exploration and optimization of the resultant search space can be utilized. It is possible to employ conventional MOEAs, e.g., the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES), and their performance can be tested for different pairs of objectives for plan evaluation. In the experimental results, the approximate Pareto front of the non-dominated solutions is effectively obtained. Further, a conflict between the proposed objectives can be seen.

Instead of requiring paired dirty and clean images for training a model to clean document images (which may cause privacy concerns), two models are trained on the unpaired images such that only the dirty images are accessed or only the clean images are accessed at one time. One model is a first implicit model to translate the dirty images from a source space to a latent space, and the other model is a second implicit model to translate the images from the latent space to clean images in a target space. The second implicit model is trained based on translating electronic document images in the target space to the latent space. In some implementations, the implicit models are diffusion models, such as denoising diffusion implicit models based on solving ordinary differential equations. 2312629AU ABSTRACT Systems and methods are disclosed for model based document image enhancement.

The low-quality input data is denoised by a diffusion model and the denoised input data is combined with a guidance term to produce output data of higher-quality compared with the low-quality input data. The guidance term is a vector-Jacobian product that encourages consistency between the denoised input data and measurements after a pseudoinverse transformation. The denoising process may be applied in an iterative fashion to generate valid solutions to the inverse problem. The augmented diffusion model is a problem-agnostic (e.g., plug-and-play) denoiser that can restore data for a variety of tasks. Example image restoration tasks include denoising, JPEG denoising, deblurring, outpainting, inpainting, colorization, high-dynamic range, and super-resolution.","['G06T5/70', 'G06T5/50', 'G06T5/60', 'G06T5/77', 'G06T2207/20081', 'G06T2207/20084', 'G06T2207/20212']"

In one aspect, the invention employs a classical blind source separation (BSS) approach with the input data (T2 or T1 distributions) being considered not only horizontally (in relaxation time units), but also vertically (in depth). The statistical variations are used for separating the principal independent components and their corresponding weighting matrix. The result of such ICA based BSS is an efficient separation of T2 components correlative to the presence of particular conditions (e.g., clay bound water, heavy oil, capillary bound water, free water, mud filtrate (water and oil), and noise). Individual saturation of estimated fluids can be calculated from the weighting matrix generated in accordance with the invention. In accordance with a further feature of the invention, it is contemplated that independent component analysis techniques may be applied to the underlying time domain data prior to its transformation to a T2 distribution. This advantageously results in “de-noising” of the signal, leading to more precise and accurate results following analysis of the T2 distribution.","['G01V3/32', 'G01N24/081', 'G01R33/441', 'G01R33/5615', 'G01R33/50', 'Y02A90/30']"

The GVF representation is agnostic to surface orientation, all dimensions of the vector field vary smoothly, the GVF can represent both watertight and non-watertight 3D shapes, and there is a one-to-one mapping between a predicted 3D shape and the ground truth 3D shape (i.e., the mapping is bijective). The vector field decoder can synthesize 3D shapes in multiple categories and can also synthesize 3D shapes for objects that were not included in the training dataset. In other words, the vector field decoder is also capable of zero-shot generation.","['G06T17/00', 'G06T19/20', 'G06F30/10', 'G06T2210/56', 'G06T2219/2021']"
