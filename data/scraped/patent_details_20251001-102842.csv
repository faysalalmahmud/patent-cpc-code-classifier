US12412340B2,Synthesizing three-dimensional shapes using latent diffusion models in content generation systems and applications,"Approaches presented herein provide for the unconditional generation of novel three dimensional (3D) object shape representations, such as point clouds or meshes. In at least one embodiment, a first denoising diffusion model (DDM) can be trained to synthesize a 1D shape latent from Gaussian noise, and a second DDM can be trained to generate a set of latent points conditioned on this 1D shape latent. The shape latent and set of latent points can be provided to a decoder to generate a 3D point cloud representative of a random object from among the object classes on which the models were trained. A surface reconstruction process may be used to generate a surface mesh from this generated point cloud. Such an approach can scale to complex and/or multimodal distributions, and can be highly flexible as it can be adapted to various tasks such as multimodal voxel- or text-guided synthesis.","['G06T19/20', 'G06T17/20', 'G06V10/44', 'G06V10/82', 'G06V20/64', 'G06T2210/56', 'G06T2219/2021']"

The character can have different facial components or regions (e.g., head, skin, eyes, tongue) modeled separately, such that the network can output motion or deformation information for each of these different facial components. During training, the network can be provided with emotion and/or style vectors that indicate information to be used in generating realistic animation for input speech, as may relate to one or more emotions to be exhibited by the character, a relative weighting of those emotions, and any style or adjustments to be made to how the character expresses that emotional state.

For drowsiness, facial landmarks can be determined from captured image data and used to determine a set of blink parameters.

A model adaptation controller obtains samples generated by an edge device and inference values generated based on the samples by a deployed ML model of the edge device. The model adaptation controller runs inference on the samples using a different ML model to generate inferences that can be used to determine whether the performance of the deployed ML model is lacking. If so, the model adaptation controller can retrain the deployed ML model using samples with ground truth values generated by the different ML model, resulting in a light-weight retrained model that can be provisioned to the edge device. This retraining process may be performed iteratively to automatically improve and adapt the ML model running at the edge device.","['G06K9/6257', 'G06N20/00', 'G06F18/2148', 'G06F18/217', 'G06K9/6262', 'G06V10/7747', 'G06V10/776', 'G06K2209/27', 'G06V2201/10']"

For areas with fragile grid infrastructure and abundant oil, gas and renewable resources, various types of energy sources can complement each other and be consumed effectively, by operating the energy networks across regions as a single integrated energy system through the implementation of multi-region power and gas coupled integrated energy system. Conventionally, a typical optimized scheduling of power and gas coupled integrated energy system does not consider the complementarity among areas with diverse device and load characteristics. Since changes and developments have happened in power-to-gas conversion technologies and intra-regional CCHP system, traditional models need to be updated and improved along with the application of tiered gas price. Based on the existing coupled power-gas flow scheduling model, the invention proposes an optimal dispatching method of multi-region power and gas coupled integrated energy system where a CCHP system is running inside a region and power-gas complementarity can be achieved among multiple regions. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is used to obtain the optimal solution of this scheduling model. The compressor linearization model is applied in order to describe transmission loss of gas network and perfect the power-gas flow model as well. Combined with the tiered gas tariff, the total operation cost of regions can be reduced and the day-ahead economic optimized scheduling can be improved as well.

A boosting process can be utilized during the unsupervised learning portion of the ML pipeline that scores clusters of training data for completeness, and further splits clusters of training data based upon the completeness scores in order to optimize the clustering of the training data. Supervised learning is then performed on the cluster-labeled training data. Bayesian learning can also be utilized to assign incident probability inferences to the clusters of training data. Once the ML classifier has been trained, the ML classifier can be utilized in a production environment to classify multi-dimensional machine metrics generated by computing devices in the production environment as being indicative of an anomaly.","['G06N20/00', 'G06N7/005', 'G06N7/01']"

The system learns, automatically, a plurality of actor perceiver predictors (APP) nodes. Each APP node is associated with a context, action, and result. The result is expected to be achieved in response to the action being taken as a function of the context having been satisfied. Each APP node is associated with an action-controller that includes an instance of a planner that includes allied planners. The action-controller is associated with a goal state and employs the allied planners to determine a sequence of actions for reaching the goal state.
