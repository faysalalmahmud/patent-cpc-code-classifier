In particular, this invention allows the breakdown of highly complex biological spectral signals into high dimensional feature space where local features of each sub-space are accurately correlated with both a specific metabolite concentration or a categorical condition. Such is achieved by a new self-learning method, that requires no human intervention. The developed artificial intelligence is able to establish its own knowledgebase when new data is fed by performing feature space transformations, searching directions of co-variance and optimizing local composition-spectral correlations. These methods allow the artificial intelligence to establish knowledge maps of both quantifications and classifications, that can be cashed for higher computational performance. In particular, direct search comprises of finding across the feature space data and dimensions that allow a direct linear correspondence between metabolic composition and spectral bands variance. Moreover, a similar approach is derived for defining the convex hull regions of different class of health conditions from body fluid spectra. Such results in the creation of knowledge maps for both quantification and classification. The present invention also allows to evaluate 'a priori' the predictability, accuracy and precision of new estimates.

US10901715B1,Lazy compilation and kernel fusion in dynamic computation graphs,"Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for lazy compilation and kernel fusion in dynamic computation graphs. One of the operations is performed by generating an input graph based on translation of user code into an expression graph. The expression graph represents control flow dependencies of operations of the generated input graph. Optimization of the input graph is then performed by iterative application of optimization rules to the input graph. An optimized version of the input graph results from the application of the optimization rules. A transformation graph then is generated by comparing changes made from the original input graph to the final optimized version of the input graph. The transformation graph provides a blueprint such that the system may recreate the optimization of a similarly structured later generated input graph without having to reapply the optimization rules. During the optimization of the input graph, the system may also generate fused blocks of just-in-time operations which the system may later optimize for parallel processing on one or more graphic processing units, and/or hardware accelerated computation units.","['G06F8/443', 'G06F11/3608', 'G06F9/4552']"
